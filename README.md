## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## I am learning laravel
First of all, I wanted to make a simple project to learn Laravel.
- User; I wanted it to perform operations such as placing orders and keeping records of subscription information.
- Admin User; I allowed all purchases made by users to be displayed.
- Sanctum was used for authentication operations.
- Eloquent was used as ORM.
- Used Sail to interact with the default Docker development environment.
- Validations were created to ensure the accuracy of the data submitted by the user.
- Database operations were achieved through migration.
- Swagger was used for API documentation.
- Faker was used to create fake data.
- Rate Limit applied throughout the application
- Yajra Datatables was used to enable the admin to perform more functional listing operations.
- Access control has been implemented for the admin panel.
- Unit tests were written to ensure the accuracy of the created API.
